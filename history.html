                    In late 2009 a game development competition called Assemblee began on the
                    TIGSource forums. The competition was
                    broken into two parts:
                    <br>
                    &ensp;&ensp;
                    Part 1: Artists and musicians created graphics, sound effects, and music.
                    Part 2: Developers used the winning art from Part 1 to create a game. RotMG came in third place.
                    <br>
                    &ensp;&ensp;
                    Many games were made for this competition using these free non-commercial resources. You'll find
                    some of
                    these still
                    out there today. WildShadow purchased commercial licenses for the works they used and continued
                    working
                    on the game
                    long after the competition was over.

                    On June 20, 2011 Realm of the Mad God was released on the Chrome Web Store. This was the first time
                    RotMG was made available outside of the official, original website.

                    departed to explore new challenges while Willem remained with Kabam and continued developing new

                    Kabam's ownership was marked primarily by a heavy increase in monetization, particularly from the
                    introduction of functional pets and later from Mystery Boxes and Set Tier items. Kabam also
                    introduced several new dungeons; most of these were medium-level, but some dungeons (particularly
                    The Shatters) during the later Kabam period helped advance the endgame.

                    Kabam announced on June 23, 2016 that Realm of the Mad God was being “transferred” to Deca Games. At
                    the same time Deca Games posted a more detailed announcement on their blog. The game officially
                    re-launched under Deca's complete control on July 21, 2016.

                    Because Adobe will no longer support Adobe Flash, the existing engine of RotMG, the game was ported
                    to the Unity engine on April 15, 2020. The “remastered” version is called Realm of the Mad God
                    Exalt.

                    &ensp;&ensp;Realm of the Mad God Exalt is the name given to the Unity port of Realm of the Mad God,

                    was
                    officially released on July 22, 2020.

                    &ensp;&ensp;The game's previous engine, Adobe Flash, is now discontinued by Adobe after 2020.
                    Therefore,
                    porting
                    the game was necessary for continued content updates.

                    &ensp;&ensp;Exalt exited the beta phase and was officially released on July 22, 2020, coinciding
                    with the
                    release of Oryx's Sanctuary. The Flash client was unsupported on September 23, 2020.

                    security,
                    significantly better performance, updated sound design including a new soundtrack, among other

                    usually closed to the public, it becomes fully open for a few days after DECA announces a new
                    session. The details of new sessions are posted on the Public Testing section of the forums and on
                    the RotMG Blog.
