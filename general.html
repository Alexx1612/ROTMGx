                <p>
                    The Wizard is the first class you'll encounter when you start RotMG. He is a long-range glass
                    cannon,
                    designed for
                    dealing maximum damage to a single target from medium to long range. He is capable of both insane
                    burst
                    and
                    sustained damage from long range, but Wizards tend to struggle with surviving.

                <h3>Who would want a Wizard?</h3>
                <p>
                    Wizards are the single most powerful class in the game. With long range, they are decent at farming
                    pots
                    (unmaxed or maxed) and melting bosses. The wizard's long range and spells make it easy to get
                    soulbound
                    damage.

                <p>
                    Necromancers are a hybrid between the Wizard and the Priest; they wield staves, while steal enemy HP
                    in
                    order to heal the group. While they lack the pure damage of a Wizard, most skulls give a max HP
                    bonus
                    and
                    the ability to heal.

                <p>
                    Necromancer is great as a bulky ranged class, a good pick for a first 4/8 or 8/8. Those who enjoy
                    staff
                    classes but die often as Wizards should definitely consider playing one. Necro enjoys the long range
                    of
                    the staff, the healing and max HP given by the Skull, and good damage.

                <h2>Mystic</h2>
                <p>
                    The Mystic is one of the more unusual classes; a decently fast staff class with the ability to stop
                    combat
                    from occuring for a short time. While Mystics in the hands of poor players and trolls have given
                    them a
                    bad
                    reputation as a griefing/trolling class, a well-used Mystic is quite powerful, capable of a unique
                    and
                    extremely powerful form of team support.

                <p>
                    The Mystic is the ultimate class for those who enjoy strategy - their Stasis allows Mystics to
                    control a
                    battle. Rather than to simply kill enemies or heal teammates, Mystics can ‘pause’ an otherwise
                    overwelming
                    force of enemies, while keeping a stasis-immune boss damagable. All the while, the Curse debuff
                    increases
                    the damage for everyone.

                <h2>Priest</h2>
                <p>
                    The Priest is a extra-long-range healing class. Although they have low defensive stats and even
                    lower
                    offenses, the Priest's range and powerful healing ability can keep themselves and thir group alive
                    even
                    through the toughest of battles.

                <p>
                    Played conservatively, Priest is, bar none, the safest class in the game. The ability to heal for
                    200+
                    HP at a time is a valuable asset. Those looking for a forgiving, easy-to-play class should look no
                    further. Priests are also the class of choice for dedicated team-support players: being able to
                    support
                    the lives of entire groups of players at a time.

                <p>
                    The Sorcerer is a long ranged pure offense class. Sorcerers lack the raw damage of a staff, though
                    have
                    extended range and the ability to damage large groups with spammable and easy to use burst damage.

                <h3>Who would want a Sorcerer?</h3>
                <p>Sorcerers excel at crowd control. With a decent pet, a 6/8 sorcerer is great at farming the godlands
                    for
                    pots, due to how many enemies you can hit. Scepters are very easy to use; unlike other damage
                    abilities,
                    they require little player management to be useful. If any sort of “clearing” needs to be done,
                    Sorcerers are among the best for the job.</p>

                    follow
                    the player's cursor while attacking. While their DPS is somewhat lacking compared to other
                    offense-oriented classes, the versatility and range of their summons provides them utility and
                    unparalleled safety.

                    a group buff on-use, giving them a bit more bulk than the average robe class.

                    The Ninja is a close-range DPS class capable of doing immense DPS to a large number of enemies at
                    once.
                    Capable of some of the highest sustained speeds in the game through their Star, Ninja is incredibly
                    adept at dodging and rushing, and has some standoff firepower in the form of a long-ranged shuriken.

                <p>
                    Ninjas are a great all-around class for those who like to “go deep”. With incredible DPS and ability
                    to
                    pierce targets for even more damage on multiple targets (or single targets mobbed by minions), the
                    Ninja
                    can dish out punishment to any enemy that it reaches.

                <h2>Samurai</h2>
                <p>
                    The Samurai is a heavy armor class that uses the katana instead of the sword, giving him increased
                    range
                    at the cost of some of his DPS. His wakizashi allows him to cripple enemy defenses, allowing other
                    players to deal more damage to enemies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Samurai are good for those less comfortable with melees; being a much less “heavy armor” class than
                    the
                    three sword classes. A superior weapon range (enhanced with certain UTs) and a fair ability range
                    while
                    keeping heavy armor make them a safer pick than the more conventional melees. The Waki also gives
                    them
                    immense burst damage and a fairly useful debuff.

                <h2>Kensei</h2>
                <p>
                    The Kensei is very similar to Samurai, at first glance: With an above average speed, plain (25)
                    defense,
                    and the Katana & heavy armor combo, they are similar. Kensei differentiate themselves with their
                    Sheath,
                    which provides heighted mobility, burst damage, and ATT (if they manage to hit). Sheaths have a
                    cooldown.

                <h3>Who would want a Kensei?</h3>
                <p>
                    Kensei are an interesting alternative to Trickster, focused more on dynamic, mobile gameplay. With
                    pretty good HP, move speed, and heavy armor, Kensei are also quite durable. This is only amped up
                    with
                    Dash Invulnerability, allowing you to flat out ignore very dangeorus attacks. These traits make
                    Kensei
                    one of the safest and fastest classes for rushing, and are also good for surviving through very
                    difficult dungeons.

                    The Knight is the tank of RotMG. Packing a defensive score that can rise to an average of 80 when
                    fully
                    geared, along with 75 vitality, it can eat tons of bullets; and, with its shield, can stop most
                    enemies
                    from shooting altogether.

                <p>
                    Those who want a tank should look no further. Knights are the single best all-around realm class,
                    eminently capable of taking on all the event bosses and killing them - whether solo or in a group.
                    The
                    Shield, in addition to killing small enemies, can prevent many from attacking at all.

                    The Paladin is a melee combat healer class. It's capable of doing significant damage from up close,
                    but
                    is
                    also capable of both boosting teammates' damage, healing them, and granting them a temporary maximum
                    HP
                    buff.

                    Paladins are a more magical melee class, relying more on their ability in solo play. Their healing,
                    HP
                    boost, and lack of Speedy makes them safer than a Warrior, without the DEF requirement of the
                    Knight.
                    Paladins are also great for team support, with decent damage even if other Pallys are around.

                    The Warrior is a pure offense melee class, capable of the (second) highest sustained DPS in the
                    game.
                    With the ability to boost everyone even further, Warriors can pound most enemies to the dust. As a
                    melee, they are limited by short range.

                <h3>Who would want a Warrior?</h3>
                <p> Warriors are another class that dives deep. Warriors can shred dungeons and event bosses alike.
                    While
                    not as fast as a Ninja, the sword and Berserk buff generally gives a Warrior a lot more firepower.
                    In
                    addition, superior defenses along with a Helm and heavy armor give actual durability to go deep.</p>
